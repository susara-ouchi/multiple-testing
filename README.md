# Implementing a software based on statistical methods that facilitates a user to decide on a “cutoff threshold of significance” or “critical significance threshold” for a dataset with large number of p-values

Research Question:
How can the already available correction methods be improved to provide a solution of a “data
driven threshold” to a given dataset of p-values?
Major Objectives of the study are,

1. To improve and unify the existing Statistical methods of deciding an optimal threshold
value of significance for multiple comparisons.
2. In addition to Bonferroni correction, FDR control, q value and permutation testing,
other methods of controlling dependencies such as multivariate testing and
adaptive testing procedures will be compared to improve already existing results
in literature.

To implement a user-friendly software that facilitates a user to decide the optimal
threshold value for a given set of p-values.
The software should take in all the p-values from the experiment and apply statistical methods to
choose the appropriate threshold, ensuring that it is possible to confidently identify significant
effects balancing between false positives and false negatives. Plots and tables will also be
designed as part of the outputs.
